# GoogleMaps-clone

WIP

using mapbox to build this clone. It's still a work in progress and more functionality will be added.

Currently you can:
1. Allow your current location to center the map at a zoom level of 15
2. Controls to zoom in and out of the map as well as rotate
3. Use the directions to plan an A to B journey either driving, walking or cycling.
