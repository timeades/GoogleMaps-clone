# GoogleMaps-clone

WIP

using mapbox, https://www.mapbox.com/, to build this clone. It's still a work in progress and more functionality will be added https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/

Currently you can:
1. Allow your current location to center the map at a zoom level of 15
2. Controls to zoom in and out of the map as well as rotate
3. Use the directions to plan an A to B journey either driving, walking or cycling.
